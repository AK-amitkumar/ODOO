Make sure you do what you need to do as administrator and setup your own user to easily manage users.
Get into developer mode (under the about Odoo menu).
Go to the user list in Odoo (where you want to hide the administrator account)
Choose action under the developer menu above the form and in the domain field put  [('name','!=','Administrator')]  (naturally if you have a different name you should put it here)
